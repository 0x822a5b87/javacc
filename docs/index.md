# <a name="top"></a>JavaCC

Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) is the most popular parser generator for use with Java applications.

A parser generator is a tool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Java program that can recognize matches to the grammar.

In addition to the parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities related to parser generation such as tree building (via a tool called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions and debugging.

All you need to run a JavaCC parser, once generated, is a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

Follow the steps here to get started with JavaCC.

This guide will walk you through locally building the project, running an existing example, and setup to start developing and testing your own JavaCC application.

### <a name="download"></a>Download & Installation

JavaCC 7.0.5 is our latest stable release.

* JavaCC 7.0.5 - 2019-10-14 ([Source (zip)](https://github.com/javacc/javacc/archive/7.0.5.zip), [Source (tar.gz)](https://github.com/javacc/javacc/archive/7.0.5.tar.gz), [Binaries](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/javacc/javacc/7.0.5/javacc-7.0.5.jar), [Javadocs](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/dev/javacc/javacc/7.0.4/javacc-7.0.5-javadoc.jar), [Release Notes](release-notes.md#javacc-7.0.5))

All JavaCC releases are available via [GitHub](https://github.com/javacc/javacc/releases) and [Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.java.dev.javacc/javacc) including checksums and cryptographic signatures.

For all previous releases, please see [stable releases](downloads.md).

#### <a name="installation"></a>Installation

To install JavaCC, navigate to the download directory and type:

```
$ unzip javacc-7.0.5.zip
or
$ tar xvf javacc-7.0.5.tar.gz
```

Once you have completed installation add the `bin/` directory in the JavaCC installation to your `PATH`. The JavaCC, JJTree, and JJDoc invocation scripts/executables reside in this directory.

#### <a name="binary-distribution"></a>Binary distribution

The binary distributions contain the JavaCC, JJTree and JJDoc sources, launcher scripts, example grammars and documentation. It also contains a bootstrap version of JavaCC needed to build JavaCC.

On Unix-based systems, you need to make sure the files in the `bin/` directory of the distribution are in your path.

### <a name="building-from-source"></a>Building JavaCC from source

Prerequisites for building JavaCC:

* Git
* Ant (we require version 1.5.3 or above - you can get ant from [http://ant.apache.org](http://ant.apache.org))
* Maven
* Java 8 (Java 9 and 10 are not yet supported)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/javacc/javacc.git
$ cd javacc
$ ant
```

This will build the `javacc.jar` file in the `target/` directory

### <a name="developing"></a>Developing JavaCC

<!---
The JavaCC committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the JavaCC codebase.
-->
Minimal requirements for an IDE are:
* Support for Java
* Support for Maven with Java


#### IntelliJ IDEA

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for JavaCC development.

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* IntelliJ JavaCC Plugin: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11431-javacc/](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11431-javacc/)
